The reporting system empowers users to report any suspicious websites, company accounts, or potential scams, promoting community safety and awareness. Users can easily submit reports, and once a specific threshold of five reports is reached for a single entity, the system automatically generates and sends a detailed notification to the cybersecurity bureau via email. This notification includes all relevant scam details, ensuring that authorities are promptly informed of potential threats. By facilitating this direct line of communication, the reporting system not only helps protect individuals from fraud but also aids cybersecurity agencies in monitoring and addressing malicious activities more effectively, fostering a safer online environment for all users.
